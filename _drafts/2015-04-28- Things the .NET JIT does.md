The C# compiler itself doesn't alter the emitted IL a great deal in the Release build. Notable is that it no longer emits the NOP opcodes that allow you to set a breakpoint on a curly brace. The big one is the optimizer that's built into the JIT compiler. I know it makes the following optimizations:

<ul>
<li><strong>Method inlining</strong>. A method call is replaced by the injecting the code of the method. This is a big one, it makes property accessors essentially free.</li>
<li><strong>CPU register allocation</strong>. Local variables and method arguments can stay stored in a CPU register without ever (or less frequently) being stored back to the stack frame. This is a big one, notable for making debugging optimized code so difficult. And giving the volatile keyword a meaning.</li>
<li><strong>Array index checking elimination</strong>. An important optimization when working with arrays (all .NET collection classes use an array internally). When the JIT compiler can verify that a loop never indexes an array out of bounds then it will eliminate the index check. Big one.</li>
<li><strong>Loop unrolling</strong>. Short loops (up to 4) with small bodies are eliminated by repeating the code in the loop body. Avoids the branch misprediction penalty.</li>
<li><strong>Dead code elimination</strong>. A statement like if (false) { /.../ } gets completely eliminated. This can occur due to constant folding and inlining. Other cases is where the JIT compiler can determine that the code has no possible side-effect. <strong>This optimization is what makes profiling code so tricky</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Code hoisting</strong>. Code inside a loop that is not affected by the loop can be moved out of the loop.</li>
<li><strong>Common sub-expression elimination</strong>. x = y + 4; z = y + 4; becomes z = x;</li>
<li><strong>Constant folding</strong>. x = 1 + 2; becomes x = 3; This simple example is caught early by the compiler, but happens at JIT time when other optimizations make this possible.</li>
<li><strong>Copy propagation</strong>. x = a; y = x; becomes y = a; This helps the register allocator make better decisions. It is a big deal in the x86 jitter because it has so few registers to work with. Having it select the right ones is critical to perf.</li>
</ul>
