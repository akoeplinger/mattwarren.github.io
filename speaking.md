Starting with the premise that "Performance is a Feature", this session will look at how to measure, what to measure and how get the best performance from your .NET code. We will look at real-world examples from the Roslyn code-base and StackOverflow.

Thanks to <a href="twitter.com/craigtptech" target="_blank">@craigtptech</a> for the image and also for his <a href="http://blog.craigtp.co.uk/post/DDD-East-Anglia-2014-Review" target="_blank">excellent write up</a>, I've included a few quotes below:

<blockquote>Matt starts by asking Why does performance matter? What do we need to know? and When do we need to optimize performance?</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Matt does suggest that we need to be careful and land somewhere in the middle of the spectrum between "optimizing everything all the time" (which can back us into a corner) versus "don't optimize anything" (the extreme end of the "performance optimization is the root of all evil" approach).
</blockquote>

One of my slides was tweeted by an attendee and at last count had over <strong>500 re-tweets</strong>, it seems like a lot of people really like statistics and in particular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling" target="_blank">Hans Rosling</a>!!
